                Based on available sources, we belong to Tharayil Mappila&apos;s
                lineage. In about 1000 AD, the Tharayil Mappilas depended on
                Kuravillangadu church and Aruvithura church for their spiritual
                needs. An unhappy incident occurred at this time. It was the
                death of a girl of Tharayil family, and the parents had to bury
                her in their family property. Tharayil Mappila seriously thought
                about building a church. He shared this idea with Vayelakkombil
                Itty Mappila and Erakonni Mappila of Mevda. They approached the
                Meenachil Kartha and requested the sanction to build a church.
                The Kartha demanded the presence of four families. To satisfy
                the demand of Kartha, one of the Tharayil brothers Johannan
                built a new house at Kootumgal and started residing there. Then
                Kartha permitted them to build the church.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;The site of the first old church is where St. Thomas
                Cathedral Church Pala is situated today. The foundation stone of
                the church was laid by the Arch Bishop Mar Johannan in July 1002
                A.D. The construction of the church was completed and the first
                Holy Mass was celebrated on Easter Sunday of 1003. The
                administration of the Pala church was conducted by the four
                families namely Tharayil, Koottumgal Erakkonni and Vayalakomb
                for the following 700 years. Later by the end of 17th century, a
                new administrative body of sixteen members came in to existence,
                elected from the public meeting organized by the church.
